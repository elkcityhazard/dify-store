Great communication skills, amazing products and great quality! I ordered a tumbler for my business and let me tell you I am EXTREMELY satisfied and pleased with my purchase. I especially like supporting her business because it is FEMALE OWNED AND OPERATED 💪🏽🙌🏽⚡️🍾 Thank you so much Heather. I will be taking this cup everywhere to show it off 😎 If you want to support a small business I definitely recommend this one!!! She also does right about everything possible ✨</p>
